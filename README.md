This is the Linked List datastructure in java. I have decided to create a datastructure everytime i will need one rather than using the JAVA's datastructures. I will do so in Python as well.

The datastructure till now I have added are:
1. LinkedList
2. ArrayList
3. BinaryTree
4. Stack
5. Vector

In future i will add Map datastrcutures and i will add marker interfaces to these datastructures as well. I will implement iterable and comparable interfaces also. I will try to make these datastructures as perfect as i can.
